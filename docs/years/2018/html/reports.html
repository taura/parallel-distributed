<h1>What I like to see in the report</h1>
<div>
<font size=-1>(the page is encoded in UTF-8)</font>
</div>

<h2>Preface</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    Several of you (legitimately) asked some specifics about the final
    report, like whether this piece of information should be included
    in the report or in more general what's exactly expected to be in
    the report.  They are all legitimate questions and I may have been
    too vague about this, but honestly I've never thought about
    instructing you with
    much specifics about the exact contents, style, format
    or structure, at least in superficial terms.  
  </p>

  <p>With that said, let me try my best to be clear about what I am
    generally expecting in the final report,
    with some minimum (superficial) requirements such as the length.
  </p>

  <p>Below, I first address what I expect for the Option 1 (Optimization
    of VGG), as this case is easier to explain specifically.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>(Superficial) requirements for "Optimization of VGG" report</h2>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li><i>A report must be a sufficiently self-contained
        document that provides the reader with information
        about what you did.</i>
      <font color=red>
        <i>It's not like the report of the SpMV hands-on;</i>
      </font>
      <p>
      in that SpMV hands-on, I, essentially, asked you to paste
      only execution logs, with a very detailed instruction
      on what you should do in each step.  One reason was that
      the main goal was exposing you to parallel computing.
      I just wanted to bring everybody on the same page
      about how you do OpenMP, how you do CUDA, how to launch
      jobs, etc.  That's why I gave detailed instructions
      on what you are supposed to do.
      The other reason was
      I wanted to minimize your work other than coding.
      </p>
      <p>
      What I expect in the final report is different.
      It is exactly what you thought you should do.
      I did not (do not want to) give you details on
      what you should do and how you should do it.
      I gave lots of hints about where you should get started,
      but in the end of the day, it is you who
      should think about and decide what to do.
      Therefore, 
      <i>the most basic information I expect from
        you in the final report is what you thought you should
        do to accomplish the goal and what you actually did.</i>
      Describe your thought and the action you took
      in a convincing manner.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>The number of pages.  Well, again, I do not want to be too
      specific, as the number of pages is something you can
      easily play with.  There can be a report of 5 pages having
      much denser information than a report of 20 pages whose
      most contents are copy of unimportant part of code or
      unimportant part of the execution logs.
      <p>
      <font color=red><i>With that said,
          I would say I would raise eyebrows if I receive a report
          of two or three pages.</i></font>
      I believe that any serious
      description of any serious effort on this problem
      won't fit three pages.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>If you worry about what to write to make it not too thin, you
      may be (wrongly) thinking it's just about inserting a few <tt>#omp
      pragma parallel for</tt>'s (or straightforwardly parallelizing a
      few loops with CUDA).  Just think about the maximum performance
      the machine is hopefully able to achieve (e.g., maximum FLOPS,
      the maximum memory bandwidth or any other limitation of the
      machine that applies to the specific code you are trying to
      optimize) and assess how close your code is to the maximum.
      I don't say they should be very close but if they are too far,
      there are much left to do and this is where your serious
      effort should begin.
      In addition, this demands an
      <i>analysis</i> of your code (why it performance only so well).
      Even if it is only about parallelization, chances are that
      you are unlikely to get a linear speedup (Px speedup with P cores)
      in the initial attempt.  This is another place where
      your <i>analysis</i> will start.
      <p>
      <font color=red><i>There will be a lot to write
          about how you understand and analyze the performance.</i></font>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>For a team report, the report can be two separate reports
      or a combined single report.
      <i>Either way, each individual
        should submit a report</i> (in the latter case, two members
      submit the same report).  For a combined report,
      <ul>
        <li>it should be a single coherent document; it should not be
          a document just stapling otherwise two separate documents.</li>
        <li>how two members worked must be clarified in a separate
          section, perhaps in an appendix
          (e.g., who did which part of the experiments, 
          who wrote which section, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
