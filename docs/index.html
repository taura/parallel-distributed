<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<div>
The main objectives of this course are to have hands-on experiences on parallel programming and good understanding about how to solve problems in parallel and what determines performance of parallel programs.
</div>

<h2>Lecture Plan</h2>
<div>
I wish to cover the topics below, ranging from a very gentle introduction to parallel programming to performance of parallel programs to fundamental topics that may be difficult to understand for first learners (due to time constraints, it's unlikely to fully cover them all).
</div>

<h3>Languages</h3>
<div>
<ul>
  <li>All written materials (slides, home pages, etc.) 
    will be in English.</li>
  <li>Lectures will be in English</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Programming Exercises Week(s)</h3>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>You will have an access to latest CPU and GPU machines
      and hands-on experiences on parallel programming</li>
    <li>This year, I emphasize a programming model targetting
      both CPUs and GPUs (OpenMP + GPU offloading)</li>
  </ul>
</div>


<a name="credit"></a>
<h2>How to get the credit</h2>
<div>
  Here are the requirements for getting the credit.


  <ol>
    <li>Submit programming exercise assignments</li>

    <li>Write and submit a final report (term paper).
      <ul>
        <li>abstract deadline: <font color=red>Jan 14th 2023 (Sat),
            23:59.</font></li>
        <li>final deadline: <font color=red>Feb 11th 2023 (Sat),
            23:59.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Both are to be submitted through <a href="https://itc-lms.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/lms/course?idnumber=20224840-10040J01" target="_blank">ITC-LMS</a>.
      </p>
    </li>

  </ol>

  <ul>
    <li>The abstract is essentially just for you to decide what you will do for the final report.
      It can be just a few paragraphs about what you will be doing for the final report.
      This is mainly for those of you who work on "Option 2" below ("solve your own problems").
    </li>
    <li>
      The final report must be a logical, consistent,
      and sufficiently self-contained document, in a PDF file.
      The topic of the final report can be chosen from
      the following.
      <ul>

          one that arises in your research or
          one that interests you.  It must be
          one for which you have a good prospect
          for applying parallelization or
          vectorization.  Think of good
          parallel algorithms to get good performance.
          Apply parallelization and/or
          vectorization, understand what is the
          maximum performance achievable, and
          investigate how close your
          implementation is.
          If you choose this option, your abstract must be

            <li>Write the report and make a PDF file</li>
            <li>Submit the PDF as an attachment to ITC-LMS assignment ("Final report option 1" or "Final report option 2").  When submitting,
              put the following in the comment box.

    <li><font color="red"><i>Update Feb 9 on segmentation fault</i></font>
      <p>I've heard from several of you that your vectorized (SIMDized) code receives a segmentation fault. There are so many ways your program may be wrong, so I cannot tell you here is why, but I thought the following problem seems common among you, so I thought I need to draw your attention.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>if you defined a vector of real as follows,
<pre>
typedef real realv __attribute__((aligned(64)));
</pre>
and defined the following auxiliary function to access a consecutive 16 elements starting from an element, like
<pre>
realv& V(idx_t i0, idx_t i1=0, idx_t i2=0, idx_t i3=0) {
  return *((realv*)&w[i0][i1][i2][i3]);
}
</pre>
<p>
  the compiler uses <tt>vmovaps</tt> instruction when dereferencing a <tt>realv</tt> pointer (i.e., <tt>realv*</tt>).  The problem is that, <tt>vmovaps</tt> requires the address to be aligned to 64 bytes (a multiple of 64).  Accessing non-aligned address causes the segmentation fault.
</p>
<p>
  In order to confirm if this is indeed what is happening to your code, run the program in GDB to get the segmentation fault, and issue <tt>disas(semble)</tt> command of GDB to know the exact instruction that causes the segmentation fault ("disassemble" is the real command name, which can be abbreviated to "disas").
</p>
<p>
  If it is indeed a vmovaps instruction, e.g., <tt>vmovaps(%rax),%zmm1</tt>, then check the content of %rax register by <tt>p(rint) $rax</tt> GDB command.  If it's not a multiple of 64, then it is indeed what is happening.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>x86 actually has another instruction, called vmovups, that does not require the address to be 64-byte aligned.  Then the question is how to let the compiler use <tt>vmovups</tt> rather than <tt>vmovaps</tt>.</li>
        <li><p>Which is what (only lightly) said in p32/57 of <a href="https://www.eidos.ic.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~tau/lecture/parallel_distributed/slides/pdf/simd2.pdf">
              this slide deck</a>.</p>
<pre>
typedef real realv attribute((vector_size(64), __may_alias__, aligned(sizeof(float))));
</pre>
<p>
  By defining <tt>realv</tt> this way, the compiler assumes it is aligned only to the <tt>sizeof(float)</tt>, which is four, and thus uses <tt>vmovups</tt>.  So I thought ...  However, it turned out that clang++ still insists using <tt>vmovaps</tt>.  g++ uses <tt>vmovups</tt> as we wished.  I don't know whether clang++'s behavior is legitimate or not.  It may be a compiler glitch.
</p>
<p>
  Given this situation, <font color="red">one resort is to use g++ instead of clang++.  </font>
</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Another way is to define the auxiliary function this way.
<pre>
realv* V(idx_t i0, idx_t i1=0, idx_t i2=0, idx_t i3=0) {
  return ((realv*)&w[i0][i1][i2][i3]);
}
</pre>
That is, it returns a pointer to the given location.  The client code using this function then has to dereference the returned pointer like this
<pre>
   v += ... * (*x.V(i0,i1,i2,i3));
</pre>
or
<pre>
   *y.V(i0,i1,i2,i3) = ...
</pre>
I confirmed that with this, clang++ uses <tt>vmovups</tt>.  Again, I don't know if there is anything in the spec or the clang++ document that explains the difference.  Also, I have not confirmed that this does not cause any adversary effect on performance.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>A surer way to use <tt>vmovups</tt> is to use an intrinsic function.
          You then have to define two functions, one for load and the other for store.
        </li>
        <li><p>A separate but related issue.  Since the original loop trip count is often not a multiple of 16, you must deal with remainder iterations.</p>
<p>
  The above <tt>V</tt> function loads/stores a full length vector (16 elements) and you want to avoid that.  I recommend using a predicated instruction.  You have to use an intrinsic function anyways.  It is left for your exercise.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <i>
    <p><font color="red"><i>update: 21 Jan, 2023.</i></font>
      I received a question about which environment you are supposed to do your work in. I've also heard from several of you who seem to be trying to do it on your laptops (some Macs and Windows). Let me explain what I expected and what the rules are.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Well, at least my initial assumption was that it goes without saying that you will be working on the server environment (taulec/tauleg000, which I collectively call taulec below) we've been using for the class. This is what I expected and anticipated to happen.
    </p>
    
    <p>Then through exchanges with several of you, I came to realize that many of you are actually trying to do it on their personal machines (I don't actually know how many are, as those questions are basically about how to make the baseline code compile/run on their laptops, an issue that you never encounter if you are doing it in taulec.</p>

  <p>So, let me make the rules and recommendations clear in this opportunity (sorry that I didn't make it clear earlier partly because, as I said above, I just anticipated everybody to do it on taulec).
    
    <ul>

      <li>No problem in developing it on your laptop first and later taking it to taulec at some point. Comparing the two would be great if there is merit in doing so (esp. comparing Intel vs. M1/M2).</li>

      <li>What about doing it ONLY ON your laptop? Well, an issue is that the server has much larger core counts (taulec has 38 cores and there is another one taulec000 having 76 cores, which I will be announcing later) than typical laptops do (2 to 4, at most 8). The requirement is not that you have to use that particular server, but that you should at least try to get most from a highly parallel environment (CPUs having many cores or GPUs).</li>

      <li> An exception is that, if you are interested in the M1/M2 CPUs recent Apple machines have and want to dig deep into them (what SIMD instructions of M1/M2 look like, what their ILP capabilities look like, how does it compare with Intel, etc.), I encourage you to do so. I consider an investigation into M1/M2 a topic of its own merit. Comparing M1/M2 and Intel in detail will make a good report.</li>

      <li>
        What about doing it only on Intel laptops having only a few cores? Well, it's not that it's not allowed, but I don't see a point in doing so. Think again about why you wanna do that before going that route when working in taulec is just one SSH command away. If your primary reason behind it is you don't know how to (comfortably) work in a remote server or Linux, consider using this as an opportunity to master it. Most remote machines are Linux and most powerful machines are remote, not on your desk. I explained in the first week <a href="https://www.eidos.ic.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~tau/lecture/operating_systems/html/jupyter.html?lang=en" target="_blank">how to access the server with SSH.</a>
      </li>
      
      <li> As an extension of this recommendation, here is a non-exhaustive list of evaluation criteria.
        <ul>
          <li>an effort to make a single-thread performance better</li>
          <li>an effort to make it scale to a large degree of parallelism
            an effort to analyze / precisely understand the performance</li>
          <li>an effort to do experiments on multiple machines (e.g., CPU and GPU, Intel CPU and M1/M2 CPU, etc.) and shed light on their commonality/difference</li>
          <li>an effort to do experiments on multiple programming models (e.g., OpenMP vs CUDA on GPU)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>A short summary; I will look forward to seeing reports that
        do something beyond just vectoring or parallelizing with a few
        cores and seeing what happens.
      </li>
    </ul>

For obvious reasons,
I cannot predict how much this affected your
experiments. The safe bet is to redo your experiments m(_ _)m

        Since a non-negligible number of students do not like
        the idea of canceling the class on Dec 26,
        I will withdraw the proposal.
        We will have a class on Dec 26, as is formally scheduled.

  <h2>
    Record of the announcement about the credit in the last
  instance of this lecture</h2>
  <div>
    
      <font color="grey" size="-1">
Here are the requirements for getting the credit.

<ol>
  <li>You participated in the classes often enough
    and generally follow what are covered in the
    class (this is a prerequisite to understand
    what you are really asked to do in what
    follows).  As you know, I have not been
    keeping track of attendance/absence, but I am
    pretty sure I can tell if somebody who has
    almost never been in the class suddenly sends
    a report.</li>

  <li>Finish the SpMV hands-on exercises we had during the class.</li>

  <li>Write and submit a final report (term paper).
    <ul>
      <li>abstract deadline: <font color=red>January 18th 2019 (Sat),
          23:59.</font></li>
      <li>final deadline: <font color=red>February 9th 2019 (Sat),
          23:59.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Both are to be submitted through <a href="https://itc-lms.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp" target="_blank">ITC-LMS</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The abstract can be just a text
  (detailed instructions will be announced later)
  of a paragraph or two describing your plan on
  what you will be doing for the final report.
</p>
<p>
  The final report must be a logical, consistent,
  and sufficiently self-contained document, in a PDF file.
  The topic of the final report can be chosen from
  the following.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <font color=blue>Option 1: Optimize Neural Network:</font>
      <p>
	I will provide dataset and a baseline serial
	program (C++) of a neural network for image recognition
        (<a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/" target="_blank">VGG</a>,
        pubilished at <a href="https://www.iclr.cc/archive/www/doku.php%3Fid=iclr2015:main.html" target="_blank">ICLR 2015</a>)
        on <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html" target="_blank">Cifar-10</a>
        dataset).  The baseline code is a C++ translation of 
        <a href="https://github.com/chainer/chainer/blob/master/examples/cifar/models/VGG.py" target="_blank">VGG code distributed with Chainer</a>.
        You optimize the baseline either on CPU, GPU or both.
        You are allowed to make a team of up to two.
        A team of two must work on both CPU and GPU.
        The most time-consuming operations are matrix multiplications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will provide a tool to submit records
        and display them in real time through a page similar to 
        <a href="../2016/examples/18mnist/mnist_records/index.html">
          this page,</a>
        which I made the last year.  
        You are asked to keep it updated with
        your records, so that we can collectively know
        how fast they are on each machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will give the toolkit (a baseline code, dataset,
        submission tool and more detailed spec of the problem).
        I will try to get them ready by the next lecture (Dec 26th).
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li> <font color=blue>Option 2: Solve your problem:</font>
      
      Solve a problem you want to get high
      performance for.  The problem may be
      one that arises in your research or
      one that interests you.  It must be
      one for which you have a good prospect
      for applying parallelization or
      vectorization.  Think of good
      parallel algorithms to get good performance.
      Apply parallelization and/or
      vectorization, understand what is the
      maximum performance achievable, and
      investigate how close your
      implementation is.
